# The problem
English is the official language of the world. Sadly so. What's more sad is that not everybody is entitled to being born [British](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auiYBtx-Vxw) or [American](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Y0gzOA_Uew) or [Australian](https://i.imgur.com/mYkC3Xx.jpg). The point is, not everybody knows English, but most are trying to learn it in some form.

# The solution
A somewhat decent solution is ["The Hellium Project"](http://www.thediction.com/), undoubtedly the most popular English-Bulgarian/Bulgarian-English dictionary out there. Its "author" was not really familiar with etymology as he thought that [Helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium) is actually named after [Hell](https://barfriday.bg/), thus supposedly naming his project the 'Hell project'. *N.B. Helium is actually named after the [Sun](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81tmcf4ueZL._AC_SL1500_.jpg), hence the name of this document.*

## The problem with that, though
Over the recent years, it has been nothing but a downhill slide for this guy. Just look at the absolute state of Bulgaria's most popular English dictionary web site. Is it a business website? He offers paid advertisments, charging monthly. Is it his personal blog? It has a bunch of embedded YouTube videos of Bulgarian songs. In addition to that, he has mentioned [Boyko Borisov](https://www.dnevnik.bg/shimg/zx860y484_4200770.jpg) and [Donald Trump](https://imgur.com/a/BEutNM1) as his "partners", along with the Federal Republic of Germany, the European Union, the Kingdom of Belgium and the Kingdom of Holland. So is it a website of a political organization or a download page for a dictionary? Let's hope it's not the latter as the guy seems severly lacking in basic English skills (i.e. the title of the page is **Welcome to Main Project on planet**). Do you wish to accept advice from someone with such a profound lack of knowledge of the English grammar? I personally do not. Furthermore, he tried (and still is) selling his 'product', although he does not hold the rights to the word database. It is no coincidence that [Greed](https://ygoprodeck.com/pics/55144522.jpg) is one of the seven deadly sins and our guy here is no stranger to it. So, after all this said...

# The solution pt. 2
Your task is to create a good mobile English-Bulgarian/Bulgarian-English dictionary. You have kindly been provided with the databases for both the dictionaries. Those appear as slightly modified variants of the [KBE Dictionary](https://www.linux-bg.org/cgi-bin/y/index.pl?page=news&id=0&key=325709858)'s databases. The English-Bulgarian database is in the popular `.dic` (**Dictionary In Compactness**) format, while the Bulgarian-English one is in the slightly less-known (although popular among Slavic countries) `.kyp` (**Keep Y'all Polylingual**) format. You will need to do a tiny bit of reverse engineering in order to find out how to read from the file. You can find both databases in the [Resources](/resources/T3) folder.

## So what now?
A good dictionary has a quick way of finding words. You will need to add a [search bar](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/bars/search-bars/) in order to achieve that. A word seaerch should be performed on every keystroke. It's important to consider that the user might not actually know how a word is spelt, hence the word search on every typed letter. aon-validly typed word should result in an approximation of the closest valid one. Furthermore, it should not take ages for the word description to be updated but unfortunately for you, the supplied database files are not exactly performance friendly.

### Look at all those (performance) [gains](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/25/bd/8b/25bd8b7f6e57cdfd17747b25d753b2ce.jpg)
According to the [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/overview/themes/) your app not being fast and responsive is as good of a reason as anything ranging from [stealing](https://static8.depositphotos.com/1206957/914/i/950/depositphotos_9145126-stock-photo-thief-of-informatics.jpg) your users' personal information, to secretly mining [Doge coin](https://i.redd.it/08gv0n1wojf61.jpg) to get rejected from being published to the [App Store](https://www.apple.com/bg/ios/app-store/). You need to **think of a way to make the word search fast**. The sky's the limit (well, actually the device's memory is a much better approximation of your limit). *Protip: While not being allowed to modify the data you are provided with, no one's saying you are obliged to use these exact databases.*

## Displaying the data
An important part of your task is to investigate how the dictionary data is stored in the database files. Once you find out, you can come up with a UI to properly display it. *Protip: It's not word-to-word relation, as words tend to sometimes have multiple meanings, so a simple one-line label would not suffice.* Also, there should be a list of **n** words, following the searched word (like the [word listbox in SADictionary](http://www.prevodachbg.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/SADictionary.png)). Moreover, there should be a separate screen for user settings (number of suggested words, do not translate on every keystroke, interpret uppercase Latin as Cyrillic and vice-versa, etc). Use [this](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitabbarcontroller?language=objc) to hold the different screens. *N.B. The user should not be responsible for changing the type of dictionary (English-Bulgarian/Bulgarian-English), but rather this should be automatically guessed from the user's input.*

## Same rules apply
Just like in the [previous task](https://github.com/georgi-karapetrov/iOS-intern-training-2021/blob/main/%D0%A22_ShikShakShok.md), do not couple any of the dictionary logic with the UI. It should be easier this time around as now you have personal experience to rely on.

# Dealing with nostalgia
Have you ever had a phone with a physical keyboard? Well, some of [us dinosaurs](https://ca.slack-edge.com/T03UCVDN2-U0CAAV0KB-6fba434e73a7-512) have! Our trembling old fingers are not used to typing on a **QWERTY** keyboard, especially when it's on a small phone screen. So, on behalf of the older part of the population, I implore, prithee do us favour and add a [multi-tap texting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_keypad) input as an option.

## Dic-ception
If you are not familiar with keypad texting, you are most certainly unfamiliar with [T9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T9_(predictive_text)) as well. In all fairness, I do not know anybody who has actually ever used it, but I only know a couple of hundred people, so the point of having it is still valid. Your task is to add T9 predictive text capabilities to the custom input field.

# Create once, use everywhere
In order to make your charmingly outdated number pad text input accessible in other applications, you need to create it as a [framework](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/DevPedia-CocoaCore/Framework.html). You can find a great resource on **Objective C** frameworks [here](https://prathma.medium.com/creating-your-custom-objective-c-framework-for-ios-apps-5d5ccf95c6c7). Create a seperate project and dive in. A simple modified `UITextFiled` should suffice, but plan carefully as frameworks are meant to be much more 'general' than a certain class doing a certain thing in your project. Keep reusability very much in mind.

## Last but not least
The application should be written in [The Swift programming language](https://developer.apple.com/swift/). A good introduction to the language's syntax and basic concepts can be found [here](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/GuidedTour/GuidedTour.html). **Nota bene: Please make sure you have got familiar with the basic aspects and concepts of the language (`Optionals`, `Unwrapping` etc) before diving into coding.** A good way to test simple ideas in Swift is by creating a so-called `Playground` (in Xcode `File` -> `New` -> `Playground...`). A *Hello world* can (and should) be written in one.
